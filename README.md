# **Cooling**
## Event Task 1: Cooling Load Calculator of a Building
SCOPE & SITE Student <br>
Objective:<br>
Create a Python program that calculates the cooling load for a building based on user input.<br>
Instructions:<br>
Area of the building (in square meters)<br>
Number of occupants in the building<br>
Type of building (residential, commercial, etc.)<br>
Outdoor temperature (in Celsius)<br>
Indoor desired temperature (in Celsius)<br>
Based on the type of building, use the following formulae to calculate the cooling <br>
load:<br>
For residential buildings: Cooling Load = 100 * number of occupants<br>
For commercial buildings: Cooling Load = 150 * number of occupants<br>
Calculate the heat transfer due to conduction:<br>
Use the formula: Q_conduction = U * A * (T_outdoor - T_indoor)<br>
Assume U (Overall heat transfer coefficient) = 30 W/m²°C for simplicity.<br>
Calculate the sensible cooling load:<br>
Use the formula: Sensible Cooling Load = Q_conduction + Cooling Load <br>
Display the final sensible cooling load to the user.<br>
Note: This assignment will assess your ability to take user inputs, apply basic <br>
mathematical calculations, and use conditional statements to determine the type of <br>
building and corresponding cooling load.<br>
Interested students add additional features (Additionally, build a simple web page to display <br>
the results.) if you'd like to challenge yourself further.<br>
Web Page Creation:<br>
Using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, create a simple web page to take user inputs for<br> 
the cooling load calculator and display the results.<br>
Deployment:<br>
Deploy the web page using a free hosting service such as GitHub Pages or Netlify.<br>
Submission:<br>
Provide a GitHub repository link containing the Python code and web page files.<br>
For validating the above use the above code by using the following values: <br>
Area of the building (500 square meters)<br>
Number of occupants in the building (10)<br>
Type of building (residential,)<br>
Outdoor temperature (45°C)<br>
Indoor desired temperature (17°C) ##
